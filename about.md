I am a final year PhD student in the Department of Chemistry at University College London (UCL), using data-driven methods to find novel polar photovoltaics.
<hr>
I completed my undergraduate integrated Master's degree in Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge, with a research project under Prof. Clare Grey and Dr Sunita Dey synthesising and characterising borate-based cathodes for rechargeable magnesium ion batteries (RMBs).<br>
Next, I completed the MSc in Materials and Molecular Modelling at UCL to refine my computational skills, including a research project with Prof. David Scanlon in which I used plane-wave DFT (in VASP) to study the thermoelectric properties of Ba2AgIO6.<br>
During my PhD, my focus has shifted to using machine learning methods for materials discovery, with a particular focus on polar photovoltaics. Recent projects have included comparing the carbon cost of various ML/DFT workflows for PV discovery, using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distances for similarity learning, and compressing absorption spectra using disentangling autoencoders (DAE).<br>
Outside of chemistry and machine learning, I like running, lifting heavy things, cooking, playing chess, reading, learning languages, and watching <s>pretentious</s> interesting films. <br>
